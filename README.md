# thewittyswan

The witty swan carries knowledge forward — a personal site combining
network security writing, literature, and a bit of playful engineering.
Live at [thewittyswan.space](https://thewittyswan.space).

Built by **Dhawal**.

## Why this stack

I'm a backend person at heart. Databases, APIs, servers — that's where
my head naturally goes. Frontend work, especially the modern
React/Next.js/Tailwind kind, has never been where I want to spend my
time — not because I dislike design, but because designing *in code*
feels heavy to me. I actually enjoy design a lot, just visually — Canva,
Figma, moving things around and seeing them change instantly. Writing
`className="flex items-center justify-between px-4"` to get the same
result has never felt like the same activity to me.

So this site is built the way it is on purpose: Jekyll, plain
Markdown, one CSS file, no build tooling to fight with, no component
tree to maintain. I write in Markdown the way I'd write a note, and the
design work — once done — stays done. No repeated frontend decisions
per post, no framework churn to keep up with. Boring, on purpose, and
genuinely comfortable to maintain for someone who'd rather be thinking
about the backend of things.

## Stack

- **Jekyll** — static site generator, Markdown-based, no server or
  database at runtime
- **Decap CMS** — browser-based admin panel at `/admin`, writes directly
  to this GitHub repo
- **Cloudinary** — image hosting for blog post images
- **Vercel** — hosting, auto-deploys on push to `main`
- **daresaydigital/decap-cms-oauth** — separate small Vercel project
  handling GitHub OAuth for the admin panel

This is one of two repos. The other, `thewittyswan-terminal`, is a
Go-based interactive terminal at `/terminal`, self-hosted separately on a
GCP VM. The two are independent — this site works standalone even if the
terminal is down.

## Local setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DhawalShankar/thewittyswan.git
cd thewittyswan
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

For the admin panel locally, also run (in a separate terminal):
```powershell
npx decap-server
```
Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin/` — this uses Decap's local
backend mode, no OAuth needed for local testing.

## Structure

- `_posts/netsec/`, `_posts/literature/` — blog posts, edited via `/admin`
  or directly as Markdown
- `home/`, `about/` (→ `/now/`), `projects/`, `glossary/`, `recommends/`
  — structural pages, editable via `/admin`
- `index.md` — the landing fork ("I'm a dev" / "I'm a homo sapien"),
  intentionally **not** editable via the CMS
- `posts.json` — auto-generated feed of all posts, consumed by the
  terminal repo for its `ls`/`cat`/`grep` commands
- `assets/css/main.scss` — all site styling, single file
- `admin/config.yml` — Decap CMS configuration

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` auto-deploys via Vercel. No manual build step needed.
